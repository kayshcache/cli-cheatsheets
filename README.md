# cli-cheatsheets
is simple app that contains command line cheats and creates alias for them in your profile or rc file. this way you can access a number of cheats quick to improve learning and productivity on the cmdln.
TODO
- Python script to install the sheets (first the interactive install script) then,
- maybe more, maybe an argparse style app for producing the sheets on the cli instead of alias.
- more sheets
